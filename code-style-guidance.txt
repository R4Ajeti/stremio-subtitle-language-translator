Code Style Requirements:

Complete, production-ready Python script with class-based architecture
CamelCase naming convention throughout
No inline comments (code should be self-documenting)
Consistent variable naming:
Lists: append List suffix (e.g., categoryNameList)
Integers: append Int suffix (e.g., videoCountInt)
Strings: append Str suffix (e.g., filePathStr)
Dict: append Dict suffix (e.g., subtitleDict)
The rest: append Obj suffix
Use descriptive class structures for code organization
Employ long, meaningful function and variable names for clarity

Importing Style
Should follow diamond shape based on impor text char length
We have 3 type of imports the order is as follows: 
First are built in python package
Second installed python package
Third are our created custom classes package
After each different import type a new line should follow

After import we have constant variables that are uppercase and snake Case
